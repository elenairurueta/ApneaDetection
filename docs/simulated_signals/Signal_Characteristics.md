# Characteristics of Simulated Signals

This document describes the characteristics of the signals generated by the `GeneracionSenales.m` file.

## Initial Configuration
- **Sampling Frequency:** 100 Hz
- **Duration of Each Signal:** 10 seconds

## Signal Generation
- **Total Number of Signals Generated:** 4000
  - Signals are divided into two categories: with apnea and without apnea.
  - The probability that a signal contains apnea is 50%.

## Signal Components
### Sum of sinusoidal signals
- **`signal1`:**
  - Frequency: Random between 0.1 and 0.4 Hz
  - Amplitude: 0.1
- **`signal2` and `signal3`:**
  - Frequency: Random between 0 and 1 Hz
  - Amplitude: 0.05

### Broad Peaks
- **Quantity:** Random between 1 and 3
- **Parameters:**
  - Offset: Random
  - Width: Random between 10 and 20
  - Amplitude: Random between -0.5 and 0.5
  - Deformation: Random between -1 and 2

### Noise
- **Quantity:** Random between 1 and 3
- **Noise Level:** Random between 0.0667 and 0.1

### Apnea Peaks
- **Probability of Apnea:** 50%
- **Quantity:** Random between 1 and 3 if apnea is present
- **Parameters:**
  - Offset: Random
  - Width: Random between 1 and 4
  - Amplitude: Random between 0.5 and 2 (positive or negative)

## Data Output
- **Signals with Apnea:** Saved in `SenalesCONapnea.csv`
- **Signals without Apnea:** Saved in `SenalesSINapnea.csv`
